Gravity effect of seamount eruptions (mass change), as spherical harmonics coefficients. Accompanying data for submitted manuscript.

The SH expansions are provided in the ICGEM gfc format: http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/ICGEM-Format-2011.pdf
The model_name field is populated with three key=value pairs: name, lon, and lat of the modelled seamount.
